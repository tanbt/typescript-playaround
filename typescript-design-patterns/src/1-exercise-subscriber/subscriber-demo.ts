/*
Practice: create a unique store to manage the app's state
* the store can have a flexible number of states
* the store emits events when a state changes
* subscriber can subscribe to the store to get a state and react to changes of that state
* state is immutable (every change creates a deep-cloned new state)
* the store can be undo to its previous state
* the store can be undo to a state at a specific time
