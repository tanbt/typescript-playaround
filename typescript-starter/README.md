# Init
```
npm i -D typescript
# yarn add -D typescript

tsc --init
```

# Step
1. Set `outDir` in tsconfig.json to "./dist"
Now all the JS file generated by `tsc` command will be located in that outDir.
2. Update npm start script with the generated JS files location

npm install -D typescript # the correct one for tsc command
```
